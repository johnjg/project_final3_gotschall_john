- I used the Tooltipster jQuery plugin to add a tool tip to the house band image in the home page sidebar. The tool top informs users that they can click the image to visit the house band page. The tool tip is formatted from within a hidden div.

# Comments:
- I used the clearfix method to correct an issue with floats
- My version of Atom reveals no issues at the time of submission.
- There are no errors visible in Google Dev Tools at the time of submission.
- Max-width of 100% was used to style img tags to ensure that all accent images in the sidebar and the logo collapse responsively, but this is not used as a media query.

                            A Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy

                            <p>Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina, also known as Chalmun's, Chalmun's Cantina, double-c/ceecee by the city militia, the Mos Eisley Cantina or simply The Cantina, was a popular drinking and dining establishment located in the city of <a href="#">Mos Eisley</a> on the desert world of <a href="#">Tatooine</a>.</p>
                            <p>Entering through a small portal on one side of the building, a small passage curved around into the main bar area. The bar, featuring many themed spigots which resembled the head of an IG-series assassin droids, was capable of producing several dozen drinks of Chalmun's concocting. Surrounded by eight different alcoves filled with stools, tables, and even a bandstand, the bar wrapped from the public area around into the more private back room. Outside of public view, several secret rooms existed to house sleeping areas for fugitives fleeing the law. At the very back of the building, an open-air hangar housed Chalmun's private shuttle which could be used routinely to transport liquor, or for escape.</p>
                            <p>Inside one of the buildings domed portions, Chalmun kept his offices. Including his own private bar, the Wookiee's office space was home to his security chief and several confiscated weapons. The back rooms of the building ran parallel to the outside bazaar which sold droid parts and scrap metal. Chalmun maintained a shop out back that sold clothes and other goods. Its domed roof sported a communications jammer disguised as a vaporator. The bartender, Wuher, used the basement to cook up new brews for his clients; previous owners had used it as a catacomb.</p>

                            <p>Identified only by a sign over the door reading simply "Cantina," the cantina was a popular gathering place for spacers, smugglers, and the center of a host of criminal activity in the spaceport of Mos Eisley, Tatooine. It was run by the Wookiee Chalmun, who purchased the cantina from gambling profits earned on Ord Mantell. The droid-hating Wuher maintained the bar during the day and the cheerful bar wench Ackmena tended the place at night. Bouncers such as Tork would regulate the rowdy crowd, tossing out those who shot other patrons.</p>
                            <p>Changing ownership over the years, the building saw use as an armory, a brewery, and a flophouse for vagrants. Before the inception of the cantina, the site was occupied by B'omarr Monks and the Vriichon brothers, who before the purchase by Chalmun, were running an illegal spice den on the site and burying bodies in the basement.</p>

                            <p>When the Clone Wars erupted between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Tatooine remained neutral as it was not a member of either institution. However, as the war approached its conclusion, the Confederacy made an attempt on Mos Eisley. The Republic troops made it to the city first, and the elite clone troopers X1 and X2 took over the cantina and used it as a staging area from which to defend the center of the city. General Ferroda, a Jedi Master managed to take the city and the troops left the cantina intact.</p>
                            <p>Chalmun's Cantina was firebombed shortly after the death of Jabba the Hutt, but it remained open five years after the Battle of Endor, when Han Solo returned there to meet with the smuggler Dravis in an unsuccessful attempt to enlist him in cargo work for the New Republic. The cantina was also open at least 15 years later, a man named Zekk—working as a bounty hunter—sought Boba Fett to share with him information on Bornan Thul.</p>
